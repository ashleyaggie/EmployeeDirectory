## Description

We weren't given anything to go off of for this assignment except for the criteria, and honestly there wasn't much in the way of usable examples, either. I did a lot of digging around other people who had done the assignment in the past to see how they achieved it, and I used some code from another assignment and modified it to fit the bill.

I'll be honest, most of the code for sorting was yoinked from [JaredP17](https://github.com/JaredP17/employee-directory) on GitHub. He had a fantastic method and I mostly understand how it works, but I wouldn't have thought of it myself. I added notes to try to explain my understanding of the structure, and in order to study it for future reference and my own comprehension.

## Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Installation

Files must be downloaded from Github. Then run npm install to get the necessary node modules. Lastly run npm start.

A ready version is also available at the [deployed website.](https://mighty-employee-directory.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

This app pulls 50 random created users from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and places their non-sensitive information in a table. Users can sort each column by ascending or descending, or use the search bar to narrow down results.
